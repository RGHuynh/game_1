Step 1: Make a game!

Gain a basic understanding of your game engine/editor and put together a complete (but small) game!
Donâ€™t worry about making art just yet, you can find a lot of sprites online that you can use. The main focus for now is on the mechanics of the game engine itself.

Things that you will learn:

Using your game engine of choice!
Creating and destroying objects.
Processing player input and moving objects on screen.
Detecting and reacting to collisions.
